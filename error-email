Dear Team, 

Please find attached the error report produced when matching State student records against our SIS student records. The majority of the records have minor errors such as inconsistencies across systems in names, ethnicities, DOBs, etc., e.g. "Lexi" versus "Lexy." To reconcile these, the following action will need to be taken: 
1) Make a phone call to the parent or legal guardian to verify the appropriate spelling, for example. 
2) If the error is in the SIS, we can make this change directly. 
3) If the error is in the State system, we will complete their error request form and submit it to the State Superintendent of Education. 
4) Approximately 5-7 days after we submit the change request, ensure the change has been made. 

The minority of errors are in the case of students appearing in the State system but not the SIS or vice versa. Sometimes, that is because students have recently enrolled with us and the data hasn't been transferred yet. For these cases, we will notice in the error report that there is only one row for the student. If the StateID is "0", the student is in our SIS but not in the state system yet. These cases will require us to investigate the individual situation. It does take 8-10 days for students to receive a StateID if they are transferring from out-of-state so that may be the issue. 

Please let me know what questions you have and I expect to have 100% these errors resolved by October 31, 2020. 

Best, 
Alyssa Liguori
